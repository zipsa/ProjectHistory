## 1 Introduction

Our application is going to provide a Job Comparator functionality to a single user. The user is going to be able to specify his/her current job and potential job offers. Additionally, the user will be able to provide comparasion settings that will change the ranking of the job offers based on different factors, fully customizable by the user based on their preference (E.g., if they would like to give more points to Yearly Salary vs other offer factors).

## 2 Process Description

### Requirements Analysis

In this activity, we will analyze the app’s requirements to have a better, more clear understanding of the user domain that the app will be serving, and overall, attempt to get as clear a picture as possible of the user’s expectations from the app.

##### Inputs

Formal specification or documentation of the app idea, and the user’s requirements of the app.

##### Outputs

More summarized, trimmed down version of the app requirements and different components. 

### System Design

In this activity we will start defining the basic architecture of the app in the form of a UML class diagram. In particular, we will start defining the classes that will be used in the app, and their interactions/relationships based on the provided requirements from the first phase. 

##### Inputs

App and user requirements.

##### Outputs

UML class diagram.

### App Design

This activity involves defining what the app will look and behave like visually. Here we will start to design the visual components, and lay them out in a graphical mockup. Additionally, we will further define how all the components designed from the previous phase will be integrated with the visual components of the user interface.

##### Inputs

The classes defined from the System Design phased.

##### Outputs

Graphical mockup of the user interface.

### Implementation

The activity where the implementation of both the System and App designs are carried out in Java code through Android studio. Here we will tie all the classes/modules together to create a fully functional Android app, which carries out all the requirements laid out in the Requirement Analysis activity. 

##### Inputs

All UML diagrams and graphical mockups of the UI.

##### Outputs

A function Android app.

### Testing

This activity will cover all the testing of the Android app. Testing will be carried out using select testing frameworks for unit and integration testing. Will also run through high level user acceptance tests to ensure the app meets all the requirements laid out in the Requirement Analysis activity.

##### Inputs

The Android App (specific classes/modules).

##### Outputs

Output from the testing framework indicating test pass or fails, both unit and integration tests.

### Documentation

The phase where all the expected behavior and features of the app are documented for a user manual. Here we will write up the documentation of the app’s functionality, which will likely also be accompanied by screenshots of particular pieces of the app being described in the documentation. 

#### Inputs

The completed, tested Android app.

#### Outputs

A markdown down documentation document.

### 3.2 Roles

1. Front-end developer (FE): Developer in charge of the front-end work of the application. Examples of: Setting up the views, actions of the buttons, etc.
2. Back-end developer (BE): Developer in charge of the back-end work of the application. Examples of: Setting up the business logic (classes in our UML diagram), etc.
3. Database developer (DB): Developer in charge of the database work of the application. Examples of: Setting up either the SQL connection, schemas or ORM.
4. Tester (QA): Developer in charge of the testing phase of the application. Examples of: unit- and integration- tests.
5. Product Manager (PM): Developer/person in charge of translating the requirements to units of work. Making sure the minimum requirements are completed.
