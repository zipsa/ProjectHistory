1. The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.
2. The performance of the app should be such that users do not experience any considerable lag between their actions and the response of the app.
3. For simplicity, you may assume there is a single system running the app (no communication or saving between devices is necessary).
4. The application should persist across runs.
